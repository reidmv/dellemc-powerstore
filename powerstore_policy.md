## CRUD operations

Here is a list of endpoints that we use to create, read, update and delete the policy

| Operation | Path | Verb | Description | OperationID |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|Create|`/policy`|Post|Create a new protection policy. Protection policies can be assigned to volumes or volume groups. When a protection policy is assigned to a volume or volume group:
* If the policy is associated with one or more snapshot rules, scheduled snapshots are created based on the schedule specified in each snapshot rule.
* If the policy is associated with a replication rule, a replication session is created and synchronized based on the schedule specified in the replication rule.
|policyCreate|
|List - list all|`/policy`|Get|Query protection and performance policies.

The following REST query is an example of how to retrieve protection policies along with their rules and associated resources:

https://{{cluster_ip}}/api/rest/policy?select=name,id,type,replication_rules(id,name,rpo,remote_system(id,name,management_address)),snapshot_rules(id,name,interval,time_of_day,days_of_week),volume(id,name),volume_group(id,name)&type=eq.Protection

The following REST query is an example of how to retrieve performance policies along with their associated resources: 
  
https://{{cluster_ip}}/api/rest/policy?select=name,id,type,volume(id,name),volume_group(id,name)&type=eq.Performance
|policyCollectionQuery|
|List - get one|`/policy/%{id}`|Get|Query a specific policy.|policyInstanceQuery|
|List - get list using params|``||||
|Update|`/policy/%{id}`|Patch|Modify a protection policy.
|policyModify|
|Delete|`/policy/%{id}`|Delete|Delete a protection policy.

Protection policies that are used by any storage resources can not be deleted.
|policyDelete|
